# AutoEncoders for Dimensionality Reduction and Data Reconstruction

This project demonstrates the use of **AutoEncoders**, a type of neural network designed to learn compressed, low-dimensional representations of data (latent features) and use these representations to reconstruct the original data. AutoEncoders are widely used for tasks like dimensionality reduction, anomaly detection, and data denoising.

## Project Overview
AutoEncoders consist of two main components:
1. **Encoder**: This part of the network compresses the input data into a lower-dimensional space.
2. **Decoder**: This part reconstructs the original data from the compressed representation.
   
The network is trained to minimize the difference between the original input and the reconstructed output, allowing it to learn the key features that represent the data.

In this notebook, we explore how to build and train AutoEncoders using **Keras** and **TensorFlow**. We aim to reduce the dimensionality of the data while maintaining its essential characteristics for effective reconstruction.

## Objectives
- Build an AutoEncoder model using Keras.
- Train the model to learn low-dimensional representations of the input data.
- Evaluate the model’s ability to reconstruct the original data.
- Visualize the latent space learned by the AutoEncoder.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: For programming the models and handling data.
- **Keras/TensorFlow**: For building and training the AutoEncoder.
- **Pandas/Numpy**: For data preprocessing and manipulation.
- **Matplotlib/Seaborn**: For data visualization.

## Key Concepts

- **Encoder Network**: The encoder compresses the input data into a smaller representation, learning the key features necessary for reconstruction.
- **Decoder Network**: The decoder reconstructs the data from the compressed representation, attempting to recreate the original input.
- **Loss Function**: The loss function quantifies the difference between the original and reconstructed data, guiding the training process.

The network is trained to minimize the reconstruction loss, allowing it to learn a latent representation that effectively captures the most important features of the input data.

## Dataset
You can use any dataset suitable for training an AutoEncoder, such as images, tabular data, or time series data. In this notebook, we use a publicly available dataset like MNIST (handwritten digits) or any other dataset that allows for dimensionality reduction and reconstruction tasks.

## Key Steps

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Load the dataset and preprocess it (e.g., normalization, reshaping) for input into the AutoEncoder.
   
2. **Building the AutoEncoder**:
   - Construct the encoder network to compress the input data into a lower-dimensional latent space.
   - Construct the decoder network to reconstruct the input from the latent space representation.

3. **Training**:
   - Train the AutoEncoder by minimizing the reconstruction loss (e.g., mean squared error) between the original and reconstructed data.
   
4. **Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model’s performance by comparing the original data to the reconstructed data.
   - Visualize the latent space and analyze the quality of the learned representations.
